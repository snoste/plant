\section{Conclusion}
This report introduces some fundamentals of designing a plant monitoring system. We presented overall information about the hardware, the network protocols and the general architecture. In conclusion, it is obvious that the design of a real system will need further studies. However, we believe that all the decision made in this paper will success in the functioning of a real plant monitoring system that could be developed in the future.
