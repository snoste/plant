\section{Conclusion}
This report introduced some fundamentals of designing a plant monitoring system. We presented overall information about the hardware, the network protocols and the general architecture. Although, it is obvious that the design of a real system will need further studies, we believe that the decisions made in this paper will lead to a functioning plant monitoring system that could be developed in the future.
