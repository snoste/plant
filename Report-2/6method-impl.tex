\section{The method and tools for implementation}
The system will be developed at Eindhoven University of Technology. Will be created a real prototype composed by a main hub made with a Raspberry Pi where connected a Xbee Board. For the sensors node, Sensors-Tag by Texas Instrument will be used. The Sensors-Tag connected to the hub will be at least two board. The main purpose of this project is to create a network of nodes. Therefore, the number of nodes connected to the hub will be overshadowed. Moreover, for the sake of simplicity, no other sensors will be added in the Sensor-Tag board despite the fact that for a perfect monitoring of a plant other sensors should be needed (e.g. Moisture Sensor).\\
For the User Interface a WebUI will be created. It will be hosted on the Raspberry Pi board and will be accessible by anyone with the website URL.
